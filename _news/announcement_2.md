<p class="justified-text">Missouri University of Science and Technology has recently honored Dr. Mohamed Elmahallawy, a postdoctoral fellow, for his pioneering work in developing secure and privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning models trained on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, aimed at safeguarding image privacy. Dr. Elmahallawy has disseminated his research widely, presenting approximately 11 articles at prestigious international conferences and journals held in Japan, Singapore, Italy, Malaysia, France, and the U.S.</p>

<p class="justified-text">His research tackles critical challenges such as security, privacy preservation, bandwidth constraints, and satellite visibility in conventional LEO satellite data transmission. In recognition of his outstanding research contributions, Dr. Elmahallawy received the College of Engineering and Computing Deanâ€™s Award for high research activity, having recently completed his Ph.D. under the mentorship of Dr. Tony Luo.</p>
