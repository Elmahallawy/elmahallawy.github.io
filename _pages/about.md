<p class="justified-text">Mohamed Elmahallawy is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Cybersecurity at Washington State University. He is also a former Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Computer Science at Missouri University of Science and Technology collaborating with <a href="https://web.mst.edu/~cswebdb/people/madria.html">Dr. Sanjay Madria</a>. His academic focus includes <strong>Cybersecurity, Cryptography, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on Federated Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and their secure and ethical deployment in distributed systems</strong>. Specifcally, his research aims to develop trustworthy and explainable AI solutions for diverse applications, including Space AI, underground mining, medical and healthcare systems, and the Internet of Things (IoT). During his M.Sc. under the supervision of  <a href="https://www.imd.uni-rostock.de/team/mitarbeitende/persoenliche-seiten/christian-haubelt/">Prof.Dr-Ing. Christian Haubelt</a> and his Ph.D. journey under the guidance of <a href="https://tluocs.github.io/">Dr. "Thomas" Tie Luo</a>, Mohamed gained valuable experience by working at several international institutions, including Rostock University in Germany, Tennessee Technological University, and Missouri University of Science and Technology in the USA. He has published over 10 papers in leading journals (e.g., <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10438925">JSAC</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10438925">IEEE IoT</a>) and conferences (e.g., <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10494442">PerCom</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10214895">MDM</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10021101">Big Data</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10436841">GlobeCom</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10279316">ICC</a>). Notably, his recent paper presented at the IEEE PerCom conference was awarded with the Best Paper Runner-up Award.</p>


<p class="justified-text">His innovative work on devevloping secure and trustworking AI in many applications has garnered significant attention, resulting in many interanational talks. In addition to his research contributions, Mohamed actively participates in the academic community by serving as a reviewer for several journals, including JSAC, TMC, TSUSC, TII, and EAAI.</p>
