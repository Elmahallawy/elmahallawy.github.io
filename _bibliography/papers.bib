  title={Stitching Satellites to the Edge: Pervasive and Efficient Federated LEO Satellite Learning},
  author={Elmahallawy, Mohamed and Luo, Tie},
  abstract={In the ambitious realm of space AI, the integration of federated learning (FL) with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations holds immense promise. However, many challenges persist in terms of feasibility, learning efficiency, and convergence. These hurdles stem from the bottleneck in communication, characterized by sporadic and irregular connectivity between LEO satellites and ground stations, coupled with the limited computation capability of satellite edge computing (SEC). This paper proposes a novel FL-SEC framework that empowers LEO satellites to execute large-scale machine learning (ML) tasks onboard efficiently. Its key components include i) personalized learning via divide-and-conquer, which identifies and eliminates redundant satellite images and converts complex multi-class classification problems to simple binary classification, enabling rapid and energy-efficient training of lightweight ML models suitable for IoT/edge devices on satellites; ii) orbital model retraining, which generates an aggregated “orbital model” per orbit and retrains it before sending to the ground station, significantly reducing the required communication rounds. We conducted experiments using Jetson Nano, an edge device closely mimicking the limited compute on LEO satellites, and a real satellite dataset. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting SEC's ability to run lightweight ML models on real and high-resolution satellite imagery. Our approach dramatically reduces FL convergence time by nearly 30 times, and satellite energy consumption down to as low as 1.38 watts, all while maintaining an exceptional accuracy of up to 96%. },

@ARTICLE{9944663,
  abstract={According to the United States environmental protection agency (EPA), every burned gallon of gasoline generates 8.87 Kg of CO2. The pollution created by vehicles’ fuel consumption has been one of the primary sources of environmental contamination that can lead to more climate changes and global warming. Thus, science and technology have converged on the idea that reducing fuel consumption benefits the environment and human health. One of the ideas for reducing fuel usage is deploying hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) using renewable energy as alternatives to gasoline. One of the main issues with EV batteries is that over operational time the battery health degrades and ultimately becomes unsafe to use. It is crucial that safety issues be addressed by researchers and battery manufacturers. Assessing and predicting battery health has been a high-priority research topic to attempt to mitigate the danger introduced by EV batteries. Although various techniques have been developed to estimate and predict the battery’s state of health (SOH), they do not cover all degradation scenarios that may affect the battery’s lifetime. In addition, the models used in estimating and predicting the battery’s lifetime need to be improved to provide a more accurate battery health state and guarantee battery safety while in use by an EV. Even though all types of EV batteries face similar issues, this paper focuses on Li-ion EV batteries. The main objectives of this paper are 1) to present various Li-ion battery models that are used to mimic battery dynamic behaviors, 2) to discuss the degradation factors that cause the battery lifespan to be degraded, and to become unsafe, 3) to provide a review of the estimation and prediction techniques used for Li-ion battery SOH and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation along with a discussion of their advantages and limitations, and 4) to provide recommendations for improving Li-ion battery lifetime estimation. This paper represents a concise source of information for battery community researchers to help expedite beneficial and practical outcomes to improve EV battery safety.},

  abstract={Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have seen a surge in deployment over the past few years by virtue of their ability to provide broadband Internet access as well as to collect vast amounts of Earth observational data that can be utilized to develop AI on a global scale. As traditional machine learning (ML) approaches that train a model by downloading satellite data to a ground station (GS) are not practical, Federated Learning (FL) offers a potential solution. However, existing FL approaches cannot be readily applied because of their excessively prolonged training time caused by the challenging satellite-GS communication environment. This paper proposes FedHAP, which introduces high-altitude platforms (HAPs) as distributed parameter servers (PSs) into FL for Satcom (or more concretely LEO constellations), to achieve fast and efficient model training. FedHAP consists of three components: 1) a hierarchical communication architecture, 2) a model dissemination algorithm, and 3) a model aggregation algorithm. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that FedHAP significantly accelerates FL model convergence as compared to state-of-the-art baselines, cutting the training time from several days down to a few hours, yet achieving higher accuracy.},

  abstract={Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, each comprising a large number of satellites, have become a new source of big data "from the sky". Downloading such data to a ground station (GS) for big data analytics demands very high bandwidth and involves large propagation delays. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution because it allows data to stay in-situ (never leaving satellites) and it only needs to transmit machine learning model parameters (trained on the satellites’ data). However, the conventional, synchronous FL process can take several days to train a single FL model in the context of satellite communication (Satcom), due to a bottleneck caused by straggler satellites. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous FL framework for LEO constellations called AsyncFLEO to improve FL efficiency in Satcom. Not only does AsynFLEO address the bottleneck (idle waiting) in synchronous FL, but it also solves the issue of model staleness caused by straggler satellites. AsyncFLEO utilizes high altitude platforms (HAPs) positioned "in the sky" as parameter servers, and consists of three technical components: (1) a ring-of-stars communication topology, (2) a model propagation algorithm, and (3) a model aggregation algorithm with satellite grouping and staleness discounting. Our extensive evaluation with both IID and non-IID data shows that AsyncFLEO outperforms the state of the art by a large margin, cutting down convergence delay by 22 times and increasing accuracy by 40%.},

  abstract={The advances in satellite technology developments have recently seen a large number of small satellites being launched into space on Low Earth orbit (LEO) to collect massive data such as Earth observational imagery. The traditional way which downloads such data to a ground station (GS) to train a machine learning (ML) model is not desirable due to the bandwidth limitation and intermittent connectivity between LEO satellites and the GS. Satellite edge computing (SEC), on the other hand, allows each satellite to train an ML model onboard and uploads only the model to the GS which appears to be a promising concept. This paper proposes FedLEO, a novel federated learning (FL) framework that realizes the concept of SEC and overcomes the limitation (slow convergence) of existing FL-based solutions. FedLEO (1) augments the conventional FL's star topology with “horizontal” intra-plane communication pathways in which model propagation among satellites takes place; (2) optimally schedules communication between “sink” satellites and the GS by exploiting the predictability of satellite orbiting patterns. We evaluate FedLEO extensively and benchmark it with the state of the art. Our results show that FedLEO drastically expedites FL convergence, without sacrificing-in fact it considerably increases-the model accuracy.},

Meanwhile, the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performance of the UWA systems is degrades as a result of water temperature, water salinity, attenuation, and multi-path propagation. In this paper, we present a modification to the conventional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based (FFT) using Fast Walsh–Hadamard transform (FWHT) instead of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Also, the proposed algorithm is encoded and decoded using Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) coding algorithm.

On the other hand, the bit-error-rate (BER) performance degrades because of several reasons such as multipath propagation, time variabilities of the channel, attenuation, and water temperature. In this paper, we aim to improve the underwater acoustic (UWA) BER system performance by using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based on fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT) instead off fast Fourier transform (FFT). We proposed a low-complexity equalization and carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation for UWA-OFDM–based FWHT using banded-matrix approximation concept.

  abstract={A Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation consists of a large number of small satellites traveling in space with high mobility and collecting vast amounts of mobility data such as cloud movement for weather forecast, large herds of animals migrating across geo-regions, spreading of forest fires, and aircraft tracking. Machine learning can be utilized to analyze these mobility data to address global challenges, and Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach because it eliminates the need for transmitting raw data and hence is both bandwidth and privacy-friendly. However, FL requires many communication rounds between clients (satellites) and the parameter server (PS), leading to substantial delays of up to several days in LEO constellations. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot FL approach for LEO satellites, called LEOShot, that needs only a single communication round to complete the entire learning process. LEOShot comprises three processes: (i) synthetic data generation, (ii) knowledge distillation, and (iii) virtual model retraining. We evaluate and benchmark LEOShot against the state of the art and the results show that it drastically expedites FL convergence by more than an order of magnitude. Also surprisingly, despite the one-shot nature, its model accuracy is on par with or even outperforms regular iterative FL schemes by a large margin.},

  abstract={Satellite technologies have advanced drastically in recent years, leading to a heated interest in launching small satellites into low Earth orbit (LEOs) to collect massive data such as satellite imagery. Downloading these data to a ground station (GS) to perform centralized learning to build an AI model is not practical due to the limited and expensive bandwidth. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution but will incur a very large convergence delay due to the highly sporadic and irregular connectivity between LEO satellites and GS. In addition, there are significant security and privacy risks where eavesdroppers or curious servers/satellites may infer raw data from satellites' model parameters transmitted over insecure communication channels. To address these issues, this paper proposes FedSecure, a secure FL approach designed for LEO constellations, which consists of two novel components: (1) decentralized key generation that protects satellite data privacy using a functional encryption scheme, and (2) on-orbit model forwarding and aggregation that generates a partial global model per orbit to minimize the idle waiting time for invisible satellites to enter the visible zone of the GS. Our analysis and results show that FedSecure preserves the privacy of each satellite's data against eavesdroppers, a curious server, or curious satellites. It is lightweight with significantly lower communication and computation overheads than other privacy-preserving FL aggregation approaches. It also reduces convergence delay drastically from days to only a few hours, yet achieving high accuracy of up to 85.35% using realistic satellite images.},

  abstract={Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) initially gained attention for developing applications that aid physically impaired individuals. Recently, the idea of integrating BCI with Augmented Reality (AR) emerged, which uses BCI not only to enhance the quality of life for individuals with disabilities but also to develop mainstream applications for healthy users. One commonly used BCI signal pattern is the Steady-state Visually-evoked Potential (SSVEP), which captures the brain's response to flickering visual stimuli. SSVEP-based BCI-AR applications enable users to express their needs/wants by simply looking at corresponding command options. However, individuals are different in brain signals and thus require per-subject SSVEP recognition. Moreover, muscle movements and eye blinks interfere with brain signals, and thus subjects are required to remain still during BCI experiments, which limits AR engagement. In this paper, we (1) propose a simple adaptive ensemble classification system that handles the inter-subject variability, (2) present a simple BCI-AR framework that supports the development of a wide range of SSVEP-based BCI-AR applications, and (3) evaluate the performance of our ensemble algorithm in an SSVEP-based BCI-AR application with head rotations which has demonstrated robustness to the movement interference. Our testing on multiple subjects achieved a mean accuracy of 80% on a PC and 77% using the HoloLens AR headset, both of which surpass previous studies that incorporate individual classifiers and head movements. In addition, our visual stimulation time is 5 seconds which is relatively short. The statistically significant results show that our ensemble classification approach outperforms individual classifiers in SSVEP-based BCIs.},

  abstract={Space AI has become increasingly important and sometimes even necessary for government, businesses, and society. An active research topic under this mission is integrating federated learning (FL) with satellite communications (SatCom) so that numerous low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can collaboratively train a machine learning model. However, the special communication environment of SatCom leads to a very slow FL training process up to days and weeks. This paper proposes NomaFedHAP, a novel FL-SatCom approach tailored to LEO satellites, that (1) utilizes high-altitude platforms (HAPs) as distributed parameter servers ( PSs ) to enhance satellite visibility, and (2) introduces non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into LEO to enable fast and bandwidth-efficient model transmissions. In addition, NomaFedHAP includes (3) a new communication topology that exploits HAPs to bridge satellites among different orbits to mitigate the Doppler shift, and (4) a new FL model aggregation scheme that optimally balances models between different orbits and shells. Moreover, we (5) derive a closed-form expression of the outage probability for satellites in near and far shells, as well as for the entire system. Our extensive simulations have validated the mathematical analysis and demonstrated the superior performance of NomaFedHAP in achieving fast and efficient FL model convergence with high accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art.},
